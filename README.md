# Semantic Search Engine

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of a **Semantic Search Engine** project. The front-end for the Semantic Search Engine is built using **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. **Semantic Search Engine**
- **Notebook Name**: `Semantic_Search_Engine.ipynb`
- **Description**: 
  - Implements a semantic search engine using state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT, MiniLM, and others.
  - The notebook processes textual data, computes similarity scores, and retrieves the most relevant results based on user queries.
  - Includes evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.
- **Front-End**: 
  - Built using **Streamlit** to provide an interactive interface for users to input queries and view search results.
- **Key Features**:
  - Text preprocessing (e.g., stopword removal, tokenization).
  - Model training and evaluation.
  - Integration with Streamlit for real-time search functionality.
